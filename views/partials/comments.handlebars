{{!-- - the partial was trying to reference 'post.comments' --}}
{{!--   - we cannot do what we did last time because the 'comments' array can't be destructured into an easily accessed variable name --}}
{{!--   - in Handlebars.js, we can use teh trusty keyword 'this' to refer to the parent object or array that's available --}}
{{!--       - data passed to a template file is technically always part of 'this'  --}}
{{!--           - but when dealing with objects we can simply access the object properties directly --}}
{{!--               - 'vote_count' instead of 'this.vote_count' --}}
